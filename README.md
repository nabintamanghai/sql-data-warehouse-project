# Data Warehouse &  Analytics Portfolio Project

Welcome to my **Data Analyst Portfolio** repository!  
This project is not to showcases my skills in data engineering rather to show my passion for data and data analytics highlighting my journey to become a proficient data analyst. Throughout this repository, you'll find examples of how I approach solving real-world data challenges and how I transform raw data into meaningful insights.

## ðŸ’¡ My Data Journey

As an aspiring data analyst, my focus is on turning raw data into actionable insights that drive business decisions. Iâ€™ve been developing a strong foundation in:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Writing complex queries to extract, transform, and analyze data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive dashboards using tools like Power BI and Excel.
- **Business Intelligence**: Developing reports that offer strategic insights to decision-makers.

Throughout this project, Iâ€™ve leveraged industry best practices and tools, focusing on creating efficient workflows and scalable data models.

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a **data analysis pipeline** where I applied my skills in SQL, data modeling, and ETL processes to gain valuable business insights.

**The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:**
1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

Key objectives:
1. **Data Collection**: Extracting data from multiple sources (such as ERP, CRM).
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Applying SQL to handle missing values, standardize formats, and create new features.
