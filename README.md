# Data Warehouse &  Analytics Portfolio Project

Welcome to my **Data Analyst Portfolio** repository!  
This project showcases my passion for data analytics and highlights my journey toward becoming a proficient data analyst. The goal is not to demonstrate skills in data engineering, but to show how I approach solving real-world data challenges and transform raw data into meaningful insights. Throughout this repository, you'll find examples of how I approach solving real-world data challenges and how I transform raw data into meaningful insights. Throughout this project, Iâ€™ve leveraged industry best practices and tools, focusing on creating efficient workflows and scalable data models.

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a **data analysis pipeline** where I applied my skills in SQL, data modeling, and ETL processes to gain valuable business insights.

**The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:**
1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

**Project involves following steps:**
- Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver and Gold layers.
- ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
- Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
- Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

**Business Use Cases**
- Customer Insights: Track customer demographics and purchase behavior. 
- Product Analysis: Identify top-selling products, pricing trends and category performance.
- Sales Performance: Analyze revenue, order patterns and shipping efficiency.
- Market Trends: Understand demand by region.

**Next Steps**
- Integrate these views with Power BI, Tableau or SQL reporting tools for visual analytics.
- Implement indexing and performance tuning to optimize query execution.
