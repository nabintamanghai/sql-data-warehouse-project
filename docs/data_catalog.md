# Gold Layer Catalog

## Overview
The Gold Layer consists of **business-ready views** designed for reporting, analytics, and decision-making. It follows the **Star Schema** approach, organizing data into **dimension and fact tables**. This layer transforms and combines data from the Silver Layer to ensure **clean, structured and efficient querying**.
